                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard to provide real-time visibility into sales performance across multiple dimensions including regions, products, sales representatives, and time periods. The dashboard serves as the central reporting tool for the sales leadership team.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Business Challenge</h2>
                <p>The sales team relied on static monthly Excel reports that were time-consuming to produce and lacked interactivity. Leadership needed a dynamic solution that would allow them to drill down into performance metrics, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions quickly.</p>
                <p>Weekly reporting took 8 hours of manual work, and insights were often outdated by the time reports reached decision-makers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Solution Approach</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Consolidated sales data from multiple sources using SQL ETL pipeline</li>

                    <li>Implemented key metrics: revenue, growth rate, win rate, and average deal size</li>
                    <li>Added interactive filters for region, product line, and time period</li>
                    <li>Created drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis</li>
                    <li>Established automated daily data refresh schedule</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
                <p>The dashboard was built on a robust data pipeline:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Extracted data from Salesforce CRM and internal databases</li>
                    <li>Transformed data using SQL stored procedures</li>
                    <li>Created calculated fields for complex metrics (YoY growth, quota attainment)</li>
                    <li>Implemented row-level security for role-based access</li>
                    <li>Optimized dashboard performance for datasets with 500K+ rows</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Impact & Results</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduced reporting time from 8 hours to 5 minutes per week</li>
                    <li>Enabled real-time decision making for sales leadership</li>
                    <li>Improved forecast accuracy by 18% through better visibility</li>
                    <li>Identified underperforming regions, leading to targeted coaching</li>
                    <li>Dashboard adopted by 50+ users across sales and operations teams</li>
                    <li>Annual cost savings of $45K in reporting labor</li>

                <h2>User Feedback</h2>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p style="font-style: italic;">"This dashboard has transformed how we manage our sales team. We can now spot issues and opportunities in real-time rather than waiting for end-of-month reports. The drill-down capabilities are particularly powerful."</p>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>The most important lesson from this project was the value of early stakeholder involvement. By conducting interviews with sales reps, managers, and executives before building the dashboard, I ensured that the final product met everyone's needs.</p>
                <p>Another key learning was the importance of performance optimization—initially, the dashboard took 30+ seconds to load, but through data modeling improvements and extract optimization, load time was reduced to under 5 seconds.</p>
